            Two of my favorite hobbies are reading and writing. I enjoy reading books of all genres. Currently some of my favorite books are "Matched" by Ally Condie, and "Hot Cocoa Hearts" by Suzanne Nelson. Books are a way which you can see the world from a differnt point of view or a way so that you can do anything. Like in a book you could imagen so vividly the brease blowing in your hair and your body just soaring through the sky. Or if you read a nonfiction book then you get the oppertunity to learn and to expand your knowledge. I think that anyone who says they don't like books just hasn't found their favorite book yet. <br>
            Another one of my favorite hobbie sas I told you is writing. I enjoy writing any genre, in fact I am enjoying writing this paragragh right now. I love to write essays, poems, personal narritives, and so many other forms of writing. I have even written a book before. Also writing is amazing because writing is the first step before reading because any thing that you have read someone has written. Even the stop sign pass by when you are driving. <br> Writing and reading are both amazing hobbies and they go hand in hand. If you think that you don't like these hobbies just promise me that you will give them another chance and if these are already apart of your hobbies then thank you. Hope that you liked my essay and I hope that you enjoyed learnign about some of my hobbies.

        <h2>Here is another poem which I wrote: <br> <br> 
        I wonder why birds fly when they can walk.<br>
I wonder why humans sleep when they can play.<br>
I wonder why cats purr when they can hiss<br>
Everyone wonders silly, funny, or serious things but, does wondering help up at all?<br>
Well in a way yes because wonder and curiosity drives us to our goals or missions.<br>
But then why wonder when you can discover.<br>
Why?<br>
That one word is what always keeps up going all the time everywhere.<br>
Every mission, goal, or action has a reason which is your why.<br>
It may sound funny i'm laughing right now,
But every thought or wonder has a reason that reason is your why.<br>
Now all you have to do is go and find that why.
